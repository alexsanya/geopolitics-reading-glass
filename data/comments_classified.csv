"🎥 Qatar, Islamism & the Gulf Divide

Qatar has long been accused of fueling radical Islam—hosting exiled leaders, financing movements, and using Al Jazeera to steer public opinion. It backed the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, even gave shelter to Yasser Arafat.

The Brotherhood’s ideology, and its links with Khomeini’s Iran, show how Sunni and Shia Islamists sometimes align. At the core of this ideology is intolerance—toward Jews, Christians, secular voices, and minorities—promoting division rather than coexistence.

Meanwhile, the UAE and Saudi Arabia see Islamism as an existential threat. They’ve banned the Brotherhood, cut ties with Qatar, and promote a state-controlled, non-political Islam instead.

"It can be said that Israel didn’t use Jordanian and Saudi airspace, as Jordan stated it had denied Israeli permission, and if they had used it illegally, it would have probably resulted in an early warning from the 2 states, however they do use the uncontested airspace over Syria and Iraq for previous strikes and the possibility for refuelling may had occurred over Syria or Iraq as Israel uses KC-707s to refuel their jets, as seen during the air raid over Iran. Additionally from the CCTV and the pictures of the damage, I believe it was not a large sortie (many sources and creators make it out to be an air raid), I believe that it could have been 1 or 2 F-35s with Delilah cruise missiles as only structural damage to one building has been seen, and the CCTV shows just 2 explosions. Aligning with the characteristics the sortie size and of the Delilah missile, this also explains the absence of the Qatari air defence as the launch platform for the missile and the munition itself are hard to detect or track. More technical note, the air defence systems acquired by Qatar would not be optimised for these situations as they’ve been tailored towards Anti-Ballistic missile warfare utilising PAC-2/3 variants with specialised warheads for said munitions, which we had seen in the interception of the Iranian missile attack. Resulting in a possible interception being extremely difficult, on top of this, the NASAMs and other shorter range systems would have been outranged by the Delilah, making detection and interception even more difficult.

Additionally going to the remark of the British KC-30 stationed in Qatar that some stated that it potentially had been used to refuel the Israelis (although CaspianReport debunked it simply), it can be assumed that it was partaking in a training exercise for the Qatari air force (as they use Rafales and Eurofighters) for aerial refuelling as Qatar has on order refuelling aircraft, as this is not an uncommon occurrence for such joint exercises whether its France or Britain do happen. However those already airborne could not do anything as most likely they had no weapons to act with when the strike occurred due to no obvious anticipation of a missile strike.

I have no information regarding if this even happened, but to me, given the information publicly available. It is the only possible explanation of what had happened, and fits the timeline when factoring in the US response to the entire scenario.
