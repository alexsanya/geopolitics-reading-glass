The US also refuse to scramble fighters, troops, or air defense forces and equipment when Russian drones invaded Polish airspace, leaving Poland and Europe alone to scramble to intercept Russian drones before they could strike critical Polish targets.

"üé• Qatar, Islamism & the Gulf Divide

Qatar has long been accused of fueling radical Islam‚Äîhosting exiled leaders, financing movements, and using Al Jazeera to steer public opinion. It backed the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, even gave shelter to Yasser Arafat.

The Brotherhood‚Äôs ideology, and its links with Khomeini‚Äôs Iran, show how Sunni and Shia Islamists sometimes align. At the core of this ideology is intolerance‚Äîtoward Jews, Christians, secular voices, and minorities‚Äîpromoting division rather than coexistence.

Meanwhile, the UAE and Saudi Arabia see Islamism as an existential threat. They‚Äôve banned the Brotherhood, cut ties with Qatar, and promote a state-controlled, non-political Islam instead.

Thank you for another well developed and presented piece. 
I doubt highly the US used the talks as a means to bring HAMAS leadership into the target sights of Netanyahu, as this implies that the US White House had a sophisticated ""plan"". The current US administration does not have such long term thinking or such abilities as the White House staff's current structure was designed for political ""loyalty"" and is geared only for 24 Hour News Headlines, and not for long term or complex geopolitical thinking. Netanyahu has almost a free reign in the region as the current American administration has not created a standard of American expectations or relationships with Israel, or with any other nation state in the region, as it has been too busy dealing with perceived internal threats  Unfortunate as it sounds, the world will have to deal with the interests, or lack of interests in US Polices for the next few years.",2025-09-14 19:52:58.740000+00:00,4,0

Which only triggers a retaliation from Iran & co. And so and so forth, until the Dominos fall and we are hurling nuclear bombs at each other.

"It can be said that Israel didn‚Äôt use Jordanian and Saudi airspace, as Jordan stated it had denied Israeli permission, and if they had used it illegally, it would have probably resulted in an early warning from the 2 states, however they do use the uncontested airspace over Syria and Iraq for previous strikes and the possibility for refuelling may had occurred over Syria or Iraq as Israel uses KC-707s to refuel their jets, as seen during the air raid over Iran. Additionally from the CCTV and the pictures of the damage, I believe it was not a large sortie (many sources and creators make it out to be an air raid), I believe that it could have been 1 or 2 F-35s with Delilah cruise missiles as only structural damage to one building has been seen, and the CCTV shows just 2 explosions. Aligning with the characteristics the sortie size and of the Delilah missile, this also explains the absence of the Qatari air defence as the launch platform for the missile and the munition itself are hard to detect or track. More technical note, the air defence systems acquired by Qatar would not be optimised for these situations as they‚Äôve been tailored towards Anti-Ballistic missile warfare utilising PAC-2/3 variants with specialised warheads for said munitions, which we had seen in the interception of the Iranian missile attack. Resulting in a possible interception being extremely difficult, on top of this, the NASAMs and other shorter range systems would have been outranged by the Delilah, making detection and interception even more difficult.

Additionally going to the remark of the British KC-30 stationed in Qatar that some stated that it potentially had been used to refuel the Israelis (although CaspianReport debunked it simply), it can be assumed that it was partaking in a training exercise for the Qatari air force (as they use Rafales and Eurofighters) for aerial refuelling as Qatar has on order refuelling aircraft, as this is not an uncommon occurrence for such joint exercises whether its France or Britain do happen. However those already airborne could not do anything as most likely they had no weapons to act with when the strike occurred due to no obvious anticipation of a missile strike.

I have no information regarding if this even happened, but to me, given the information publicly available. It is the only possible explanation of what had happened, and fits the timeline when factoring in the US response to the entire scenario. Just wanted to provide my speculation as many people often discredit the situation as Qatar taking a knee for Israel.",2025-09-14 19:53:33.068000+00:00,1,0

They spent their money not on helping Palestinian people but on the goal of exterminating all the Jewish nation. The world has gone mad.

Who is corrupting the establishments in Europe and the United States? Qatar
Let's not forget who gave shelter to one of the terrorists accused of planning the twin disaster in the United States, while he was being sought by the FBI, Qatar gave him shelter.
Qatar has many enemies, and instead of sitting quietly and profiting from the West, it decided to corrupt and betray the trust the West gave it.
Qatar has no allies left at all. Iran has stepped down from the geopolitical stage and does not pose a significant threat to its neighbors, so it cannot protect Qatar.
Qatar invested over a trillion dollars in the US economy and gave a plane as a gift, all this to buy American support, while true allies of the US don't have to give them anything; the US helps them for free.
